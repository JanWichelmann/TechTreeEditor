[b]Introduction[/b]
This application allows to edit the technology tree of Age of Empires II: The Conquerors in a graphical way. This includes editing attributes of units and researches, assigning them to building slots and defining dependencies. A new project can be created by importing a DAT file or using built-in templates; the export function writes the whole project data into a given base DAT. There is also a rendering form that allows to test e.g. graphic displacements and projectile spawn positions.

The software is available in english and german language; this should be determined automatically on initial startup. Else you can set the language in the "?" menu manually.
