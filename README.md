This application allows to edit the technology tree of "Age of Empires II: The Conquerors" in a graphical way. This includes editing attributes of units and researches, assigning them to building slots and defining dependencies. A new project can be created by importing a DAT file; the export function writes the whole project data into a given base DAT.

Currently this software is under heavy development and by far not finished, so it is not recommended to use it in real modding projects for the time being.

This software is published under the MIT/X11 license. Please read the LICENSE file for further information.

Lots of credit goes to the creators of the Advanced Genie Editor (http://aok.heavengames.com/blacksmith/showfile.php?fileid=11002) which source code I used to create a C# port of its genieutils library.

Also I'd like to thank the developers of OpenTK (http://www.opentk.com/) for their wonderful C# OpenGL wrapper allowing me to write an efficient renderer for my technology tree data structure.
